# PyTorchStudy
Studies on PyTorch

Requirements to implement this tutorial:  
jupyter, torch, torchvision, numpy, matplotlib

After git clone, follow these:
  1) Enter the "PyTorchStudy" directory.  
  2) Make virtual environment:  
    - virtualenv venv  
    - venv\Scripts\activate (Or "source venv/bin/activate" in Mac)  
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

If you succeeded to follow the instruction above,
you now have virtual environment (named 'venv') to run the tutorials here.
